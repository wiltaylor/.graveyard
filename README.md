This repository is a collection of projects that I have abandoned. Feel free to use the code for your own purposes.

As the projects are abandoned, please don't contact me with requests to update them.

## Pull Requests
There is no point raising pull requests on the project as I have configured github to automatically reject them.

## Repository Structure
Each project is placed in its own subfolder and will have its own README explaining what it is (sometimes).

## Security Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

These projects are abandoned and unmaintained. They may contain security vulnerabilities, bugs, or other issues. Use the code at your own risk. No warranty or support is provided, and no security updates will be made.

**By using any code from this repository, you acknowledge that:**
- The code may be vulnerable to security exploits
- No security patches or updates will be provided
