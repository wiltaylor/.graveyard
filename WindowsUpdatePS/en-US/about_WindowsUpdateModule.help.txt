FEATURES
	Key features of this module are the following:

	* Ability to scan a machine that is not connected to the internet and use another machine 
	  which is to download its patches.
	* Ability to maintain a repository directory with windows patches in it. Clear out old un-used patches
	  etc.
	* Ability to scan and install patches on machines which don't support powershell.
	
HOW TO: How to patch a machine not connected to the internet.
	1) #On your internet connected machine run the following command:
	   Receive-ScanCab
	   
	   #Alternativly if you want to scan and install updates on a machine which doesn't support Powershell 4
	   #run the following command. This will also copy VBScripts required to do the scan and install.
	   Receive-ScanCab -LegacyTools
	   
	2) #Copy the files generated in the previous step to the machine not connected to the ineternet.
	
	3) #Before completing this step you must do it from an elevated powershell session or command prompt.
	   #If the machine is running powershell 4 and you have this module installed run the following
	   #command. Make sure you point the -cab parameter to where you stored wsusscn2.cab.
	   $Updates = Get-WindowsUpdates -Available -Cab c:\temp\wsusscn2.cab
	   $Downloads = $Updates | Get-WindowsUpdateDownloadList
	   $Downloads | Export-CLIXML .\Report.xml
	   	   	   
	   #If you don't have powershell running on the target machine you can run the vbscript instead.
	   #Note: This VBScript will generate a report.xml file which can be imported by powershell.
	   cscript.exe ScanUpdate.vbs /CAB:c:\temp\wsusscn2.cab /OUTPUT:c:\temp\report.xml
	   
	   #When one of the two methods above is completed you will have a report.xml file. Copy this back 
	   #to your internet facing machine.
	   
	4) #On your internet facing machine run the following command. Make sure you point to where report.xml
	   #is stored.
	   $Updates = Import-CLIXML .\Report.xml
	   $Updates | Add-WindowsUpdatesToRepository -Verbose
	   
	   #This command will download all the patchs to a folder called UpdateRepository in the current directory.
	   #Once complete copy the folder or move it to a location accessible from the non internet connected
	   #computer.
	
	5) #On the non internet connected computer run the following command. Make sure to update the path
	   #of the OfflineRepository to where you stored it.
	   $Updates = Get-WindowsUpdates -Available -Cab c:\temp\wsusscn2.cab
	   $Updates | Install-WindowsUpdate -OfflineRepository c:\UpdateRepository
	   
	   #If you don't have powershell running on the target machine you can run the vbscript instead.
	   cscript.exe InstallUpdates.vbs /REPOSITORY:c:\UpdateRepository /CAB:c:\temp\wsusscn2.cab
	   
	6) #At this point it is recommended to restart the machine. However if you would like to check if 
       #a reboot is required you can run the following command and look at the RebootRequired property.
	   Get-WindowsUpdateAgentInfo
